Hello to you !!!

My name is Éloi Strée, I am game developer some time by hobby, some time by profession.
I love to teach when we give me the opportunity to do it.

I want to restart my career on the Lynx R1 that bring the augmented reality through "stereo camera screens".
Proper XR that augment reality bring new topic, so I am going to re-learn my job.

On my path I drop some note, playlist, search, demo, experiments...
Plenty of tools that could be useful to you if you start in the industry.

So if you are in to that, I invite you to follows my adventure through some Git respositories:
- [Old Quest 2](https://github.com/EloiStree/CodeAndQuestsEveryDay) (Note and workshop of 2019)
- [Lynx R1](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloLynxR1) (My adventure in coming with the Lynx R1)
- [Quest 3](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloQuest3) (Exploration of the Quest 3)
- [Android XR: Quest & Lynx](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloAndroidXR) (Common ground of those two devices)
