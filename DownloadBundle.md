# Hello you

Welcome.

My name is √âloi Str√©e, I am a developer that would like to keep a maximum of my prototypes and researches free and opensource.  
My solution: Keep my code open source and online but give the possibility to download and access my public hard drive to donator as a bundle.
  
ü§î _Onetime donation ?_  
You can pay one month, download everything you need and stop your account.  
Totally fine with me.  

‚ò† _Piracy ?_    
The Patreon and Tipeee philosophy is about supporting your creator. 
As soon as the pirate help me on any level: I am good.    


üèÅ My only aim by doing that is to invite the community to invest on me and my works to finance my curiosity of new technology.    
I don't schedule to be rich and if I became rich, it is the J. Carmack rich definition:

Idea: "Being rich is to be able to order pizza for you and the team in aim to continue to code all day."  
Quote: "... your definition of wealth is being able to have pizza whenever you want ..." Lex F. resuming John Carmack.
