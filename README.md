## My impossible rules / Modo

Once in my life, I took the time to write those lines down. That became my motto but also my impossible rules I have never succeeded to follow.
I like those because they kind of define well what I seek in life.

# Currently on

## XOMI
As Diablo 4 is playable with Xbox Controller, it was a good occasion to rework this code.  
This tool allows you to simulate one xbox controller from UDP message sent to it.  
It allows to make testing accross several account on several computers.  
XOMI: https://github.com/EloiStree/2022_01_24_XOMI/releases/tag/V0.0

## ChatGPT, Whisper and Undertone.

I plan to work on EEG project in the coming years for OMI.
And the nearest topic that is close to EEG in behaviour is vocal control.
So I working a vocal to actions tool. The project is half open because it use a bought plug-in.

## OMI

Open Macro Input is a concept of a toolbox of toolboxes.    
But the main engine it is design for is Unity to be multiplaform and work on XR as the projet originated from my will to create a keybaord for VR.    
The other main reason of using Unity here is to use the Job system and comptupe shader when required to.   
Unity OMI: https://github.com/EloiStree/2020_03_11_UnityOMI  


# In coming in my wanted list

## Audio Spectrogram to action

That high on my tier list. Learn to master spectrogram in aim to make it easy to glue some action to pattern in it.  
Basically I want to be able to "beat box" some sound to make action in my app and game instead of using vocal.  

## Mirror ( & Others ) 

To be able to make my computer communicate with each other, I use Hamachi and UDP.   
But I would like to enjoy a Unity Mirror Relay code that can be use in Unity and other apps by using Unity Relay per platform.  
What is the point ? The idea here would be to have a boolean and command driven network easy to deploy and to hook at.  
 
## AOMI

I don't have time for that now. But that something that was my priority list if I had to work more time with Molengeek.    
A tool that allows with ADB to make some actions on phone and VR headset with the same design of JOMI and XOMI.   
 
It would be a good addition to the toolbox to help game testers and botters on phone.

# Notes 

### I don't publish on store

*"Life is too short to spend time selling and protecting my codes"*  
I spend so many hours trying to put games and codes on the store and beeing refused at the end.
Don't expect my production to be on stores.

Find all my works on a online drive:
[https://eloi.page.link/bundle](https://eloi.page.link/bundle)

### Social media

I realized after years of failing that I am big fat noob in communication...   
I tried twitter, reddit, youtube... I am Sooo bad at it.  

So I decided to delete them all and to focus on three communications:  
- This landing page on [GitHub / EloiStree](https://github.com/EloiStree/) 
- My [Discord](https://eloistree.page.link/discord) where you can ping me to talk.
- Some video on Youtube: [https://eloi.page.link/links](https://eloi.page.link/links)
