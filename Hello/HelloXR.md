Hello to you!!!

My name is Éloi Strée; I am a game developer, sometimes by hobby, sometimes by profession.  
I love to teach when we give me the opportunity to do it.  

I want to restart my career on the Lynx R1, which brings augmented reality through "stereo camera screens."  
Proper XR that augments reality brings new topics, so I am going to re-learn my job.  

On my path, I will drop some notes, playlists, searches, demos, experiments...  
Plenty of tools that could be useful to you if you start in the industry.  

So if you are into that, I invite you to follow my adventure through some Git repositories:  
- [Old Quest 2](https://github.com/EloiStree/CodeAndQuestsEveryDay) (Notes and workshops from 2019)
- [Lynx R1](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloLynxR1) (My adventure in working with the Lynx R1)
- [Quest 3](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloQuest3) (Exploration of the Quest 3)
- [Android XR: Quest & Lynx](https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloAndroidXR) (Common ground of those two devices)
- [XR Teacher of the Web](https://github.com/EloiStree/XRTeachersOfTheWeb) (Who is teaching XR on the web)

You can find my help and download my projects here:
- [Discord: Eloi Support](https://eloistree.github.io/r/discord)
- [Tipeee Donation](https://en.tipeee.com/eloistree)
- [Download my games](https://eloistree.github.io/r/download/)
- [Projects](https://github.com/EloiStree/ProjectsID)


Hope you the best.  
  
May the code be with you !  
  
Kind regards,  
Éloi
