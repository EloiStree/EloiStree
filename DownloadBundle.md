You can find most of my work, game, app and code online.  

I work with an open source pay wall donation system:
- You can find lot's of my work free on the web.
- 95% of my code is open source somewhere on GitHub.
- Most executable are on store with a price but you can find them on my drive
- 90% of executable are on the drive and 1-10% are on the store (it takes to much time publishing)
 

The handing page of the drive is here:  
Download my drive from: [GitHub](https://eloistree.github.io/r/download/github/) - [Patreon](https://eloistree.github.io/r/download/patreon/) - [Tipeee](https://eloistree.github.io/r/download/tipeee/) - [Discord](https://eloistree.github.io/r/download/discord/) - [KoFi](https://eloistree.github.io/r/download/kofi/)  
But you need to be monthly sponsor to have access to it.    

I am a bit messy, if you don't find what you are looking for,  
Feel free to ping me on Discord üòâ.  

Kind regards,  
Eloi

## Hello you

Welcome.

My name is √âloi Str√©e, I am a developer that would like to keep a maximum of my prototypes and researches free and opensource.  
My solution: Keep my code open source and online but give the possibility to download and access my public hard drive to donator as a bundle.
  
ü§î _Onetime donation ?_  
You can pay one month, download everything you need and stop your account.  
Totally fine with me.  

‚ò† _Piracy ?_    
The beerware philosophy is about supporting your creator. 
As soon as the pirate help me on any level: I am good.    


üèÅ My only aim by doing that is to invite the community to invest on me and my works to finance my curiosity of new technology.    
I don't schedule to be rich and if I became rich, it is the J. Carmack rich definition:

Idea: "Being rich is to be able to order pizza for you and the team in aim to continue to code all day."  
Quote: "... your definition of wealth is being able to have pizza whenever you want ..." Lex F. resuming John Carmack.
