By learning how to use NFT in my future game, I realized that Mining crypto money is not hard to setup on my computer.
And I realized that in a pool of miner you can have several people mining for the same wallet :) .

That a good news, because that means that if anyone love my works in general and want to help me. 
He just need to mine on my pool on my wallet address.

That not a lot but more we are, more it become a thing.

*To give you an example.*

If I mine on [Ezil](https://ezil.me/personal_stats?wallet=0x60F6A0Dc848eD1D0a27dE73630eFdF46A6a11039.zil1hk56lsyf3sevka356c9r0eyglf592nldc83zas&coin=eth) for one day with my NVidia 1070 I can win about 2€ per day.   
So at the end of the month (60€) and at the end of the year (700€)  

So if my community mine one day per month to help me ?   

Contributor | Month | Year
-|-|-
10 |  20€ | 240€
100 |  200€ | 2400€
400 |  800€ | 9600€

It bring me just enough to pay the rent and/or the food of a year.

I am not counting electricity cost here because the aim is donation without using payement system. That all.
You spend 60-80% of electricity cost to give me 100% of the donation you target and you indirectly help the crypto community to hash.

So what for you. If you just want to help nothing except my appreciation.

My appreciation is not enough ?

Every worker working in a pool is track in the API.
And every donatoin in crypto is registered.

When you mine on my pool, use a worker name that represent you:
twitch_eloistree, youtube_eloistree, any_eloistree

Based on that collected data, you will have special threatement in my live stream, credit , application and game.
