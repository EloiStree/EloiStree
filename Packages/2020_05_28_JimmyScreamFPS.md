### Description
Jimmy screamer is a FPS debug tool that uses audio sound to remind you that you are under 60-40 FPS. It has been created and is still used by me to check during my playthrough on Oculus Quest  that I am respecting the 55-65 FPS required.  

Don't forget to remove it from your release build. To avoid weird moment with your users... ;)
