 There are plenty of reason.
But it is mostly an Android reason that a Lynx reason.

-----------------

This is a repository of apps to be used on the Lynx-R1 mixed reality headset. To use this repository, first install the F-Droid app from https://f-droid.org/. You can install it using the [Lynx Toolbox](https://toolbox.lynx-r.com/install) or the [Lynx DemoManager](https://portal.lynx-r.com/downloads/item/12/). Alternatively, you can install it through Wolvic if you give Wolvic the permission to install apps. Once F-Droid is installed, you will need to give it the permission to install apps. While the system settings are open, it is much easier to navigate using the scrcpy utility provided in the [Lynx Toolbox](https://toolbox.lynx-r.com/scrcpy) or the DemoManager.

Currently it serves 16 apps. To add it to your F-Droid client, scan the QR code (click it to enlarge) or use this URL:

If you would like to manually verify the fingerprint (SHA-256) of the repository signing key, here it is:

It is based on that https://app.tangoapp.dev/  
Git source: https://github.com/yume-chan/ya-webadb  
That is usable on Phone in general and not only on Lynx

# [Question: Can we play 2D application on Lynx R1 ? ](https://api.github.com/repos/EloiStree/HelloLynxR1/issues/68)  
  
 You can play some application in 2D space that will be in the 3D space to interact.
But some application will just play as 2D application in front of the lens...
As it is just a phone at the end.

Meaning that if you want to do a cardboard with the Lynx... You can technically do it.

 As a developer in front of the Kinect or in use of the Lynx you are exposed all day to the infrared light.  
I know it is without danger... But is it ?  
   
I should look around the web to be sure.

# [Question: What happens if I do a Unity screen capture ? And a Unity screencapture X4 ?](https://api.github.com/repos/EloiStree/HelloLynxR1/issues/72)  
  
 In Unity you can screen capture. 
Will it be with shader ?
And if we use the tool to increase the quality of the capture what will the image look like ?

Answers : I take a screenshot without the lens shader and (in current firmware nov 2023) don't take the image of cameras.
So for now you will just have a beautiful screenshot with black background.

# [Topic, Game : What are the game that are runnable in WebXR on the Lynx R1 ?](https://api.github.com/repos/EloiStree/HelloLynxR1/issues/73)  
  
 To try to play WebXR on Lynx you will probably need this ADB command:
`adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d https://github.com/EloiStree/HelloLynxR1/issues/73 `

Web XR is suppose to be abstract.   
If you can run it on a device you could be able to play it on others.  

So the question is simple, what are the game that are playable on WebXR that don't use controller to be played ?

The browser by default on Lynx R1 is https://wolvic.org/en/start/ .


> Note: Youtube VR video and Poney video are not working.

> At least on the version 1.1.7 of Lynx R1

# [Archive: The texture ](https://api.github.com/repos/EloiStree/HelloLynxR1/issues/84)  
  
 When I started to play with the Lynx and the code, the first stuff I tried to code is a Lynx ViewMaster with Luxxo and the lens of the device. As I like the texture. It is the identity of Eloi Lab Application in memory of that.

What is Monado again ?


- B2B vs B2C : Lynx is versatile.  Blurry answer.
"aka R1 supports B2C short/mid term, but is really a B2B headset. Lynx plans for greater B2C competition in the longer term. sounds good to me"

Maybe install android driver:

- The phone one I was using years ago:

The user at the end did not connected the Lynx to the computer.
If you don't have a usb C port, you can use an adaptator or a by a USB 3 to USB C cable
