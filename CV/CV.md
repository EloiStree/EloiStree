I don't have the will or the time for CV.  
  
For me it is just a administration task that I am doing when mandatory.   
  
You would not fall on me except if you need me and so we don't care of what I did in the past.  
Just check with me what I can do with you in the present around a online coffee talk. 
  
But if you still need it ðŸ˜‰  
You can find them here.
