If you are here, it means that you are wondering about the license on one of my code or works in general.

The license is a **community salary** license:  

> I only desire a salary to be based on community donation in aim to avoid NDA, private code, ads and bad sponsor(s).     
> Having a community salary allows me to spend all my time on exploring new-tech, refactoring my code and maintaining the toolboxes.  
> If you are using my tool, works or if I am beeing useful to you, I invite you to make monthly donation to help me live.  
>        
> You can use all my work commercialy, just return the elevator if you are able to.     
> Take in consideration that I need a minimum to live and additional income allows me to hire people on topic I am not good at.
