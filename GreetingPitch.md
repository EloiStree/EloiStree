## Chat GPT version

Greetings,

Allow me to introduce myself as Éloi Strée. I am reaching out to seek your assistance in supporting my artistic endeavors.

As a passionate individual, I am profoundly inspired by the enchantment of coding. My aspiration is to become a developer deeply rooted in community engagement and collaboration. I am driven by an insatiable curiosity to explore the boundless possibilities that emerge from coding and emerging technologies in this extraordinary era of human existence. All other pursuits pale in comparison to this driving force.

My lifelong plan is to immerse myself in the captivating realm of Extended Reality (XR) through research and development. Specifically, I am devoted to creating a remarkable software known as OMI—an open-source macro's toolbox designed to enhance communication between humans, software, games, and machines.

I wholeheartedly welcome any form of assistance that may enable me to pursue this vision. Should you believe you possess the capacity to accelerate my objectives or enhance my work, I encourage you to reach out to me.

In terms of my "business model," I propose to consolidate all my work into a comprehensive bundle, readily accessible to donors via a secure drive. Simultaneously, I remain committed to keeping my projects open source and accessible across the web for those who are inclined to explore them.

To sustain myself through this creative journey, my objective is to secure the support of 1,000 donors who believe in my potential, thus generating a modest income to sustain my livelihood.

For your convenience, the bundle can be accessed through the following link: https://eloi.page.link/bundle. If you feel compelled to join this endeavor, please do not hesitate to contact me or contribute to my crowdfunding page.

May the spirit of code guide your path.

Sincerely,
Éloi Strée
