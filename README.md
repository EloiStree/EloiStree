## Install My Main Toolbox

In any project I am working on, you will find these packages in the manifest:

```
"be.eloistree.quickgitutility": "https://github.com/EloiStree/2019_07_21_QuickGitUtility.git",
"be.eloistree.license": "https://github.com/EloiStree/GeneralLicense.git",
"be.eloistree.unitypackagefacilitator": "https://github.com/EloiStree/2019_07_21_UnityPackageFacilitator.git",
"be.eloistree.generaltoolbox": "https://github.com/EloiStree/2021_10_03_EloiGeneralToolbox.git",
"be.eloistree.zhulistaticsingleton": "https://github.com/EloiStree/2022_11_22_ZhuLiStaticSingleton.git",
```
- Git Utility is a tool to manage git on the computer with command line on Windows.
- Unity Package Facilitator helps me to import, export, and create packages fast in my projects.
- Eloi General Toolbox is the toolbox of code that I am tired of recoding and is most of the time in all my projects.
- General License is just a package to remind that I participated in the project at some point.

These four lines are copied here because they are the ones I use the most.

## My Impossible Rules / Motto

Once in my life, I took the time to write these lines down. They became my motto but also my impossible rules I have never succeeded in following.
I like these because they kind of define well what I seek in life.

# Currently On

## XOMI
As Diablo 4 is playable with Xbox Controller, it was a good occasion to rework this code.  
This tool allows you to simulate one Xbox controller from UDP messages sent to it.  
It allows for testing across several accounts on several computers.  
XOMI: https://github.com/EloiStree/2022_01_24_XOMI/releases/tag/V0.0

## ChatGPT, Whisper, and Undertone

I plan to work on EEG projects in the coming years for OMI.
And the nearest topic that is close to EEG in behavior is vocal control.
So I am working on a vocal to actions tool. The project is half open because it uses a bought plugin.

## OMI

Open Macro Input is a concept of a toolbox of toolboxes.    
But the main engine it is designed for is Unity to be multiplatform and work on XR, as the project originated from my will to create a keyboard for VR.    
The other main reason for using Unity here is to use the Job system and compute shader when required.   
Unity OMI: https://github.com/EloiStree/2020_03_11_UnityOMI  


# Coming Soon in My Wanted List

## Audio Spectrogram to Action

That's high on my tier list. Learn to master spectrograms with the aim to make it easy to glue some action to patterns in it.  
Basically, I want to be able to "beatbox" some sounds to make actions in my apps and games instead of using vocal.

## Mirror ( & Others ) 

To be able to make my computers communicate with each other, I use Hamachi and UDP.   
But I would like to enjoy a Unity Mirror Relay code that can be used in Unity and other apps by using Unity Relay per platform.  
What's the point? The idea here would be to have a boolean and command-driven network easy to deploy and to hook into.
 
## AOMI

I don't have time for that now. But that's something that was on my priority list if I had to work more time with Molengeek.    
A tool that allows with ADB to make some actions on phones and VR headsets with the same design as JOMI and XOMI.   
 
It would be a good addition to the toolbox to help game testers and botters on the phone.

# Notes 

### I Don't Publish on Stores

*"Life is too short to spend time selling and protecting my codes."*  
I spent so many hours trying to put games and codes on the store and being refused in the end.
Don't expect my production to be on stores.

Find all my works on an online drive:
[https://eloi.page.link/bundle](https://eloi.page.link/bundle)

### Social Media

I realized after years of failing that I am a big fat noob in communication...   
I tried Twitter, Reddit, YouTube... I am so bad at it.  

So I decided to delete them all and to focus on three communications:  
- This landing page on [GitHub / EloiStree](https://github.com/EloiStree/) 
- My [Discord](https://eloistree.page.link/discord) where you can ping me to talk.
- Some videos on YouTube: [https://eloi.page.link/links](https://eloi.page.link/links)


# In Conclusion

You are at the right place.  
Ping me when you need üòÄ:

May the code be with you,   
Kind regards,  
Eloi S.
