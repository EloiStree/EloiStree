# For the story

Welcome you.

My name is √âloi Str√©e, I am a developer that would like to keep a maximum of my prototypes and researches free and opensource.  
  
It did not work for me as today, March 2023, I am starving with no money on my account to eat.  

I decided to propose a compromise.  

Most of my release will be at a symbolic 3.14‚Ç¨ on all the store.  
And at 5‚Ç¨ per month if you want to have a full access to my backup harddrive through Mega.nz    

ü§î _Onetime donation ?_  
You can pay one month, download everything you need and stop your account.  
Totally fine with me.  

‚ò† _Piracy ?_    
The Patreon and Tipeee philosophy is about supporting your creator. 
As soon as the pirate help me on any level: I am good.    


üèÅ My only aim by doing that is to invite the community to invest on me and my works to finance my curiosity of new technology.    
I don't want to be rich and if I became rich, it is the J. Carmack rich definition:

Idea: "Being rich is to be able to order pizza for you and the team in aim to continue to code all day."  
Quote: "... your definition of wealth is being able to have pizza whenever you want ..." Lex F. resuming John Carmack.

## What is on the Mega.nz account ?

Until I can pay a 2To:
- All my games and applications I design or collaborated on   
  - (no client app or under NDA content are present in this disk)  
- All my 3D (Ender, CNC), laser assets and Unity 3D element I created myself.  
- Some of the code I took the time to put on the backup harddrive to fit in the 15Go.  

When I will be able to pay the 2To:  
- Everything I created that is not created for a client or affected by NDA  
- Every projects code (less the bought assets inside it if the project is too recent)  

## I see a project on you channel but not on the harddrive?

Every project has a start id YYYY_MM_DD_ProjectName, so just share me the id and I will comeback to you.
