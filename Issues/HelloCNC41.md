 So I wanted to spare some time by using one change of bit only.
But to do that I had to do some tabs and contour before going for smaller bits.

The problem is that tab are there to maintain before you remove but it don't support welly the vibration produced by the milling.

So it broke my smaller bits with vibration.
And "worst" the tab broke at some points.

Maybe you can do that with bigger tab that you new to saw. 
I will try in the future. But for now it is on my forbidden check list.

 Ok, I had an idea I need to try.

1. Spray a thin surface 1mm with water repulsion product.
2. Cut the circuit in this surface
3. Put the surface in a conductive paint bucket
4. Let's dry, check the circuit and recover with a 0.1-0.5 mm surface on top.

The number of time that I don't want to spend time on my clamping and had to deal with the consequence of it:
- The wood move because I did not take time to clamp enough
- The wood move because I did not want to screw to much
- The wood move because the wood supporting the clamp moved during the process
- The wood is not perfectly flat because I put only 3 clamp instead of 4.
- By not clamping enough, the drill touch the border and make the holes wood vibrate and so the machine and so the screw ... Worst case scenario because it means that you have maintenance behind this stupid laziness of willing to win some time.

 You can do 30 cm piece in the 3018 pro but...
If you have one mistake your motor will hit the border and lost the coordinate he had.
- So instead use maximum 28cm. 
-Don't set your wood perfectly on the bed but more in the center of it.

 Ok so I had the chance to start with my CNC with a plastic box for isolating the sound. In my first week I used to put my CNC with the controller on. But it required me to clean it every week. 

So I unplug it and fixed it at 20 cm behind a wall in the plastic box.. But still dust find a way.

So now I am testing with the controller outside the box.

PS: more your feedrate is low more dust is produced. So it is important if you don't want to clean it every 2-7 days to make ships and not dust.

 Here where my "dream" objectifies of this project:
-  [x] I need to experiment the possibility of doing circuit board in the wood or from the wood to not be dependent of heavy industry for semi-production (a town for example)
-  [x] CNC is a must have skills in life now that it exists and that it is easy to have access to. So just learning enough to not be afraid when I need to use one.
- [ ] At the end of this small adventure should at least finish a small version of my foot-board or belt-board in a mail-able version. 
- [ ]  I need to understand what would block me to create CNC/IOT ready to be assembly/welded objects by mail.
-  [ ] I need to be able to estimate in the future the price(s) of a small production and conception of CNC/Micro-Controller objects  linked to Unity with bluetooth :) . 

As expected by the rule of PI,  I did not have time to do all that.
And I learn a lot more in other direction ^^.

Nice try. The objective are still valid for the rest of my exploration.

Note: In both material after 300-400 mm/s at 700-1000 RPM and depth of 0.3, we can start to see the metal bend a bit (1-3°)  to the materiel when cutting. But not enough to break (apparently).

 Just wanted to write down a mistake I did againt.
- I supposed that the wood I was using was the same that the other one that was the same production... But some are 5-7.5-8.4. They don't really care. So I accidentally cut 5 mm in a 8.4 mm dept wood...
- Second mistake was to not caliber some reset point in case of accident. Leading when I restarted to have 0.15-0.4m of difference and 1-3° of inclination lost.
- Third mistake, I use once again clap to fix my wood. Leading in case of heavy vibration to make it move from 0.5 cm. I always underestimate the power of vibration in case of the bit not cutting good of the bit doing an error.  Moving seem nothing but when you don't have re calibration points.... It is almost like the wood is lost. (About 1-3 hours of bit digging lost.

 Today I experimented to do my Geta with the CNC but several mistakes were made.

1. Don't hesitate to screw the machine else it can move or pop out of it socket. (I did it heavy but not enough in fair to break the gear on the long term, when I should really be careful to do it hard enough)
2. Same joke with the bit holder that I did not screw enough... Leading to production of "wood line" instead of chips. And at the end to make the bit holder with the bit to be push away at high speed of the router. Very dangerous if it was not in protected case.
3. I use double face sticker to hold the wood. But it stills lead the wood to move a bit leading to imperfection and step missing. Christopher replaced them by screwing directly in the wood and attaching that in the base. (Very effective)
4. I used in Fuison 360 the default "Ramp" of 2D pocket. But the CNC need to be able to use the 3 axis at the same time when you do that. This one don't like that. Leading to bug. Leading to miss step. Leading to 4 fail attempt before we find that problem.

# 62 | [Observation: Jig & CNC height calibration + human error height calibration.](https://github.com/EloiStree/2020_08_01_CNC41Month/issues/62)  
  
 Ok in the Sho-gi Jig experiment, I head some problem. 

I wanted to cut piece hole then remove the splinter wood on the top.
So I ask the machine to just make the contour of it... But

# 1: human factor
When you caliber the machine, you use a piece of paper if you have not a probe to do it.
Meaning that you have 0.05-0.3 mm that can be a variant based on human appreciation.

# 2: Wood bending
When you make the height of your CNC, all pieces seem the same but if you look closely, you will see some 0.05-0.15-0.3 mm of difference because most wood that you use on CNC are carving due to the thickness.

# 3: CNC protector imperfection
You can have CNC manufacture imperfection because you builder and you can make error.
But the CNC don't come with a protecting surface. Meaning that you protection is maybe not perfectly horizontal to the drill machine. Leading on different height from left to right. For me it seem to be 0.2 mm by 5 cm.

# 4 : Jig fitting
When you put in and out the piece in your jig you have massive height imperfection:
- your piece don't fit perfection due to laser and don't reach the bottom totally
- you have some dust in the jig and you did not cleaned properly
- the piece moved because of vibration in your jig.


# Conclusion 

If you use a jib, you it to pocket and drill but not to do the surface of several piece.
Except if you want to dedicate time to check every detail before processing. (Counter productive for me).

They are other problem but that the one I encounter first.
