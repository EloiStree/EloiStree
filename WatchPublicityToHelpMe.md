I am against publicity and intrusive marketing...  
But, I won't teach it to you, that a lucratif way to bring food on the table...

I have a webpage where you can play some of my Unity game with WebGL.  
And where publicity are all around it.  

It is not the best way to help me. But that one way that don't cost you and don't cost me to much time.  
Just to have fun playing while you help me.
